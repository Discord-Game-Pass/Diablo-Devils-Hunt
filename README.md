## Game description

[Diablo IV: Devil's Hunt](https://diablo.discordgameepass.com) is a Discord minigame inspired by the Diablo franchise. 

Sometimes, a demon appears on a channel and players must kill it as fast as possible. 
Diablo has many features:
- Dozens of demons from seven different classifications, including Furies, Calamities, and even Nightmares that only come out at night.
- Fight your way through lesser demons and level up, earning rewards and prestige along the way. Prepare for the biggest battles ahead...
- 40+ levels with different titles, weapons, benefits...
- A complete shop with more than 25 items available using demon souls as your currency.
- When a devil arrives in the boss arena it's your time to shine! Defeat it solo or together and earn epic rewards.
- Fight against Diablo and all seven of the Prime Evils. Discover real demons never before used in the video games.
- State-of-the-art stats system. Track your progress, growth, the number of demons you've killed, your rank and much, much more.
- Purchase a Hunter's License to receive notifications on when demons spawn and special events take place that change the game!
